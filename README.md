# 🗂️ Automatic File Sorter

The **Automatic File Sorter** is a simple yet powerful Python tool that helps you keep your folders clean and organized. 

It automatically sorts files in a selected directory into categorized subfolders based on their file types — for example, <tt>.jpg</tt> files 
go into Images, <tt>.pdf</tt> files into Documents, and <tt>.mp3</tt> files into Music.

# 🚀 Features

- Automatically sorts files by file extension/type
- Creates destination folders if they don’t exist
- Handles all common file types (images, documents, videos, music, etc.)
- Easy to customize — add or modify categories as you wish
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

# 🧠 How It Works

- You specify a target folder (e.g., your Downloads or Desktop directory).
- The script scans all files in that folder.
- It moves each file into the correct subfolder according to its type.
